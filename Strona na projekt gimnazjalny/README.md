# Webiste about Italy

During the middle school we had to do a "project" about subject: "Which EU country would you visit and why?".

It required from us to do some research, prepare final presentation and give it.

However our project supervisor decided that it was too little and we suggested that we can make a website that would present all the info from the presentation in more accessible way. He agreed and here we are.

The website should be still online [here](http://projekt-gimnazjalny.cba.pl/).
