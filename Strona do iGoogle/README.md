# Gadget to iGoogle

iGoogle is one of closed Google products. It was interactive homepage that could be customize by gadgets (like weather, news, etc.).

I was using this page as a homepage on every PC at that time. I realized it would be nice to have a bookmarks bar there and as I couldn't find anything that would fit my needs I create a simple website hosted on cba that was showed via iframe on my iGoogle.

The bookmarks looked like icons on Windows desktop using favicons as icons.

After the closure of iGoogle this website was abandoned.
